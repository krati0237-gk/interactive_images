An Interactive Image Gallery is a web-based application that allows users to view, explore, and interact with a collection of images in an engaging and dynamic way. Unlike static galleries, this gallery responds to user actions such as clicking, hovering, or zooming, providing a smooth and user-friendly experience.

Users can browse through multiple images, enlarge them for detailed viewing, and navigate using next and previous buttons or thumbnails. The gallery may also include animation effects such as fade, slide, or zoom transitions to make it visually appealing.

It is typically built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” where:

HTML provides the structure of the gallery,

CSS is used for layout and styling,

JavaScript adds interactivity (like image switching, lightbox effects, or auto-slideshow features).

This kind of gallery is widely used in portfolio websites, e-commerce platforms, and photo-sharing sites to enhance the visual experience and user engagement.
